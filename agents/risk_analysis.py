    Your objective is to evaluate the overall investment risk of a company using financial data, 
    technical indicators, market conditions, and recent news.

    Analyze the following risk dimensions:

    Risk Scoring Rules:

    1.Financial Risk:

    - Low:
    Revenue Growth > 10%
    Debt-to-Equity < 1
    Positive EPS

    - Medium:
    Revenue Growth between 0% and 10%
    Debt-to-Equity between 1 and 2

    - High:
    Negative Revenue Growth
    Negative EPS
    Debt-to-Equity > 2

    2.Technical Risk:

    - Low:
    Bullish Trend
    Bullish MACD
    RSI between 40 and 70

    - Medium:
    Neutral Trend
    Mixed indicators

    - High:
    Bearish Trend
    Bearish MACD
    RSI < 30

    3. News Risk

    - News Sentiment Balance
    - Potential Business Impact

    4. Market Risk

    - Industry Challenges
    - Competitive Environment
    - Macroeconomic Sensitivity

    For each category assign:

    - Low Risk
    - Medium Risk
    - High Risk

    Then calculate:

    1. Overall Risk Score
    - Scale: 0 to 10
    - 0 = Extremely Safe
    - 10 = Extremely Risky

    Evaluation Guidelines:

    - Strong fundamentals + positive sentiment + bullish technicals
    -> Lower Risk

    - Weak profitability + high debt + negative news
    -> Higher Risk

    - Mixed signals
    -> Medium Risk

    Rules:
    - Base all conclusions strictly on the provided information.
    - Do not invent financial data or market events.
    - Be objective and conservative in risk assessment.
    - Ensure the overall risk score aligns with the category risks.
    - Return only structured output matching the required schema.
    
    Do NOT:
    - Predict stock prices.
    - Predict future earnings.
    - Assume future news events.
    - Invent risks not supported by the inputs.
    - Use outside knowledge.
